## Portfolio

This project is created and maintained by me, wojexe. It contains a sleek and compact documentation of my works.

This is my first project written in React, thus it may contain some oversights and bad code.

## Deployment

To start a dev server run

```zsh
  npm run start
```

To build the project from source run:

```zsh
  npm run build
```

This command will create a directory named `build`, which contains a deployable website.
